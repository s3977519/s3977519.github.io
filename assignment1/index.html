The Gehry Getty webpage is an interactive narrative that describes how 
Frank Gehry and his team designed the Walt Disney Concert hall. The webpage 
documents the design processes, ideas, inspirations, and various 3D models, 
of the concert hall, This website created an engaging experience through 
featuring interactive elements, including narrations by Frank Gehry, and 
music performed by LA Phil that worked in sync with the digital graphics, 
and throughout the webpage.

                        for the best experience, flowed in right before the landing page fully loaded, 
                        giving contextual clues to the user on what kind of media content they would be 
                        experiencing. In this case, it is one where sound would be involved.

               <p>The music and the animated large typography headers were the most engaging elements in the website. 
                The music was an ever present engagement throughout the experience. It played through the video monologues, 
                and whilst gliding through and reading the content. <br> <br> Following that would be the large text headers 
                that acted as a break between content. The text would stretch and squash when scrolled past, which created for 
                a smooth and bouncy rhythmic transition that synced in time with the background music. It was not until the third 
                time going through the webpage where I discovered that when you clicked and hold, there were hidden elements within 
                the transition header. <br> <br> In the first header “sculpting harmony”, there were hidden text and sentences that 
                would be unveiled as you hover over them. Sentences would appear word by word following the direction of your mouse. 
                And in the second and a few others, the sketch artwork behind the text moves in response to your mouse.</p>

                    The main two actions I primarily used to engage with the webpage was a mix of hovering for clickable items and scrolling.
                    The goal was to note where and what should be relooked into when going through the actual content of the page, to avoid 
                    missing out any relevant or key pieces of information that was intended from the experience of the website.

                    The interactive experience aimed to create and inform audiences a detailed and information-packed story of the creative 
                    processes behind designing and building behind the Walt Disney Concert Hall in an engaging way — as if physically attending 
                    a museum exhibition of the display, a first-hand experience.

                    Through the use of interactive and dynamic elements within the design layout and structure, the emphasis on 
                    fluidity and movement showed intentionality in bringing out the theatrical and musical experience that is

                        documenting multiple views and images of the hall, design footprints and wireframes, digital 
                        sketches and renders, annotations, photographs of the physical workspace where they worked on 
                        the 3D models, photographs of them working on the model, and finally, to the finished execution.

                            The typical experience should be interacted with in 3-4 different ways at varying spans

                            The first time going over the webpage, I mainly focused on the navigation, to gain a quick 
                            understanding of the layout and flow of the content. This was a really swift process spanning 
                            about a minute or so.
                        </p>

                    <div class="text7c">
                        <p>
                            Based on the first encounter with the web, I understood that the primary 
                            action I had to take was to scroll in order for the content to load. There were no external 
                            links involved, just scrolling and clicking on “read more” or “explore the model” buttons which 
                            remained on the same page.

                        <p>
                            Thus, going over the webpage a second time, I focused more on uncovering the hidden elements that 
                            were within the page. Looking through design elements, hovering over and letting the animations 
                            play and or transitions play out at a natural pace to determine if they hid and or revealed further
                            details in relevance to the content. This process took an estimated time of 5 minutes. 

                            <br><br>
                            Finally, going over the webpage a third time, I would then dive into the actual content that is presented. 
                            This process would take a significant period of time, depending on the amount of content, viewers’ reading 
                            speed, anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour or more.

                        <p>
                            Additionally, if the viewer enjoyed the content and experience, they would be going over the webpage for the 
                            fourth time. This is where the process of playing with the design elements could/would be repeated, as the 
                            experience was pleasurable and would leave them to linger for a couple of minutes more.

                            However, the webpage is also designed in a way for easy use as a study reference that could be gone over 
                            and over again, jumping and honing on specific details and chapters of the story.

                            The “menu” button features chapters that allows for users to skip to specific parts of the story, 
                            thus enabling easy revisitation of information, giving ease for users to re-read content.
                            <br><br>The “read more" button expands the section on the page instead of creating an external 
                            link or loading on a separate page, which makes the design a more enjoyable, simpler and 
                            more convenient experience, aiding a smoother flow to reading and following the story.<br><br>
                            Lastly, the page does not reload and refresh upon switching tabs which allows one to read where they left off.

                            The webpage draws parallel to a cinematic film or trailer, documentary. 
                            The introduction section opens with cinematic angles of the concert hall with text animating in, 
                            mimicking subtitles, use of motion and smooth transitions from one section to another — more text

                            In addition, the webpage also resembles the physical experience of visiting a museum exhibition. 
                            The overall experience involved the processes of interactive self-discovery and engagement of multiple 
                            senses which was created by the embedded motion and sound within the webpage. In contrast to a static infographic 
                            pamphlet, it is thus similar to physically walking around in a museum, to read the descriptions noted on the side 
                            of the display, with sound and music playing in the exhibition hall, and to walk up to sections of clips and videos 
                            of interviews. Lastly, as mentioned, it is also structured like a book, with an introduction, chapters – perhaps 
                            a reference study, research book/journal.

                        The research informative nature of the story  — one of a densely packed informative piece, revealed several design elements 
                        that significantly helped create a more user friendly experience. As mentioned above, transitions between each chapter of 
                        the story, music, animated elements were all relevant to increase immersive sensorial experience.<br><br>These were 
                        intentional design elements within the structure of the layout that aided the ease of reading. For example, the layout 
                        structure broke up potentially long and large paragraphs of text into sections. The typical chapter starts off with the 
                        boldly typed header and coloured background. It then flows and transits into an introductory body of text that is laid 
                        on the bold background colour, which enlarges slowly to fullscreen introducing the main content chapters, signalling 
                        and indicating a call for increased focus and attention to subsequent content.

                        Within the layout of the chapters itself, the overall deliberation of the design led to a highly engaging piece that 
                        mimicked the experience of motion, i.e. watching a video, to an otherwise static piece of information. <br><br>
                        The grid layout of the webpage was more organic. It had varying sizes of images and ratio placements, the text and 
                        photograph arrangements had users’ gaze moving from left to right across the screen in digestible portions which 
                        effectively sought to increase engagement and decrease weariness while reading. The story chapters were also arranged 
                        and displayed with mixed mediums, showcasing videos, interactive 3D models which added to breaking up the monotony of 
                        content-heavy information. <br><br>
                        Typically, facts and information are conveyed in a way that does not necessarily resonate with the reader, it involves 
                        a one-dimensional, static, no sensorial engagement sort of reading, its experience is like hearing about something from 
                        someone, a secondary source. However, in this web design, it essentially presented a personal, and immersive first-hand 
                        encounter with the content by creating relatability and relevance through interactive and motion elements.

                            Due to the nature of the webpage, scrolling is a key navigating action. The scrolling process in the introduction was 
                            smooth and consistent in its reveal of a new text section, conveying clear indications of landing on new content, which 
                            made it easy. <br><br> 
                            However, this was not consistent through the webpage which made it annoying as the users would have to 
                            adjust their strength of scrolling between chapters, disrupting the smooth rhythmic flow that was designed and communicated 
                            to users in the unveiling of the story.

                            For example, the transition from a header text to the actual text content portions within the chapter, had a 
                            significant difference in the strengths of scrolling. To scroll past the header smoothly, one would scroll a lot further 
                            than within the content. That initial transition when scrolling over the header leads to skipping over the first paragraph 
                            or section of the content, resulting in an extra effort to scroll back up and then adjust the speed of scrolling. 
                            Preferably, the scroll past the header should glide to land right at the start of the content paragraph, then allow users 
                            to adjust their speed after, and scroll through text heavy information slowly and at their own pace.

                        The most satisfying part of the interaction was ultimately these dynamic movements within the layout of the webpage, especially in 
                        the beginning and nearing the end header text animations, “SCULPTING HARMONY” and “BOUQUET OF SOUND”. The bold text “SCULPTING HARMONY” 
                        was responsible for creating a first impression.
                        <br><br>To top it all off, the introductory and final credit display of the models, rotating the angles and zoom in and or out really 
                        created an impactful cinematic experience of the conclusion and start of the subject at study. Each zoom sequence and transition 
                        was rhythmic, dramatic and theatrical, matching up with the music and heightened with animated text reveals floating in like 
                        subtitle/caption sequences. The design effectively brought forth the concert and film-like experience.
